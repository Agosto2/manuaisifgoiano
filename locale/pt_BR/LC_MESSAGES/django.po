"<b>What makes Helios different/better than other voting systems?</b>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Helios is truly verifiable. Each voter obtains a smart ballot tracker "
"which can be checked against the Ballot Tracking Center to ensure that the "
"ballot was received and tallied appropriately. What this means is that no "
"one, not even the administrators of the Helios Voting system, can alter your "
"vote.\n"

"<b>I’ve heard of “voter-verifiable” before, what’s different about Helios?</"

"<p>Many voting systems claim to be voter-verifiable. We believe voter-"
"verifiability is critically important, and we support the efforts of other "
"organizations to help improve the voting machines used in public-office "
"elections. However, we believe that more extensive verifiability is needed, "
"with voters able to ensure that the tallying process, not just the recording "
"of their ballot, was performed correctly. We call that “true verifiability.” "
"Others have called this concept “end-to-end verifiability” or “open-audit.”\n"

"<p>No, you should not. Online elections are appropriate when one does not "

"notably US Federal and State elections, the stakes are too high, and we "

"<p><b>About your vote:</b></p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li> Your vote on Helios is considered extremely private.</li>\n"
"<li> Helios uses SSL to transmit data between your browser and our servers.</"
"li>\n"
"<li> In addition, Helios uses end-to-end encryption so that, even after SSL "
"decryption, your vote is <em>still</em> encrypted with the election key. "
"Helios servers never see your vote. </li>\n"
"<li> In the normal process of a Helios election, your individual vote is "
"never decrypted: encrypted votes are combined into a tally, using a process "
"called homomorphic encryption, and only the final tally &mdash; never an "
"intermediate tally &mdash; is decrypted.</li>\n"
"<li> The trustees of your election, if they all collude, technically have "
"the power to decrypt your individual vote. This action is strongly "
"discouraged and is against Helios policy. It is why high-security elections "
"should use at least 3 trustees with different allegiances. </li>\n"
"<li> Helios may, at your election administrators' discretion, serve as a "
"trustee of your election. This does <em>not</em> give Helios any power to "
"decrypt your vote. In fact, it is probably preferable, since without "
"Helios's collaboration, the remaining trustees cannot decrypt individual "
"votes. It is our policy that Helios, when acting as a trustee, will only "
"decrypt the election tally, never an individual vote.</li>\n"

"username and password that were generated for you, or a Facebook, Google, "
"Yahoo, or Twitter login. Helios uses the appropriate login interfaces to "
"those external services so that it never has access to your credentials at "
"those services. </li>\n"
"<li> For the purposes of election auditing, Helios stores your name, email "
"address, and the minimal eligibility information needed to qualify you, for "
